# RUL Estimation

This project is a continuation of a previous projected developed for my thesis, [Data Anaytics and Processing for Remaining Useful Life Estimations](http://rdw.rowan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3433&context=etd) and hopes to further develop the project based on our conclusions and ideas discussed in the future works section. This also includes other methods discussed more recently.
